          - cherry-pick
          - rebases
          - merge conflicts

        - h2: Cherry picking
        - p: diff-and-apply from anywhere to anywhere
        - p: consider '-x' to provide bread crumbs
        - code: |
            $ git cherry-pick -x COMMIT
        - class_notes: |
            Cherry pick allows you to take one or more commits from one place
            and put them in your tree. -x leaves bread crumbs. A way to get
            changes without having to do a merge.
      -
        - h2: Rebasing
        - p: A rebase re-plays a set of commits onto a newly merged head,
             presenting a continuous flow of history instead of a jagged
             set of merges.
        - p: Rebases can be done done at pull time.
        - code: |
            $ git rebase master
            $ git pull --rebase
        - class_notes: |
            Rebase is powerful, useful, and confusing. You can think of your
            commits like a pile of cards. You can take a few cards off the top
            of the deck, add some more cards from a different deck, then put
            your cards back on top. Rebase does alter history, so be careful
            with using it on shared branches.

        - h2: Merge conflicts
        - p: Conflicts happen. There are some tools to work with them,
             but typically conflicts require a human to make a decision
        - p: Git will guide you through the steps necessary to resolve.
        - class_notes: |
            Create a conflict between branchs and attempt to merge.
            Walk through the steps necessary to resolve it.
