        - p: Used to manipulate history while shuffling commits
        - code: |

            $ git rebase -i HEAD^^^
        - class_notes: |
            Interactive rebases allow you to manipulate the cards before you
            put them back on the deck. Merge two cards together, remove a
            card all together, you've got options.

        - p: Used to store changes without committing them
