        - h1: Git Branches for fun and profit
        - class_notes: |
            Git branches are very cheap. They are unique per-clone.
            Thay can exist entirely for your own usage and never shared,
            or they can be long lived coordinated different stream of
            development.

        - h2: Reasons to branch
        - ul:
          - keeps master branch in a working state
          - keep teams happy
          - allows multi-tasking of development
          - merge changes when ready
          - point release trees
        - class_notes: |
            Keep master working by only putting working changes on it.
            Allow teams to work on their own branch on a feature before
            bringing it in. Can work a bit in isolation on a known working
            starting point.

            Can create a branch and check it out as one step.

            source.
